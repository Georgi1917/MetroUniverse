                    <p>
                        Watchers seem to resemble canines, both in behaviour and appearance. The watcher can commonly be found standing up on two hind legs 
                        sniffing the air or baying into the distance. A watcher's mouth is angled upward and sunken into the face, giving it a face reminiscent 
                        of a bull dog or boxer breed of dog. A pair of phalanges adjoin either side of the mouth and have some teeth lining the lower edge. 
                        These are probably used to give the watcher a greater surface area when biting, or to amplify its howls.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Watchers are the remnants of some undiscerned mammalian animal; likely descendants of rats, dogs, or even wolves (Exact taxonomy 
                        is unknown, however, due to the significance of mutation upon the watcher's behaviour and appearance). Their behaviour resembles 
                        such animals, they hunt in packs, they howl, they actively hunt as opposed to scavenging. Further evidence of a canine ancestry lies 
                        in The Gospel According to Artyom, where a pack of mutated dogs depicted as Watchers attack an young Artyom.

                    <p>
                        A demon can be described as having a knobbly spine, short tail, and three pairs of limbs: two prehensile arms, two legs, and two 
                        large wings. They also have a long head with a blunt snout, consisting of a bat-like nose, eyes with vertical cat-like slit pupils 
                        set far apart on the head, and a large mouth with 4 canines and several secondary teeth. The backs of demons are covered in sparse, 
                        short black fur and there are folds of skin on the base of the neck. Their wings are attached to their body with a massively muscled 
                        arm-like limbs that are almost twice the diameter of their thigh muscles. This explains how demons can fly, despite their massive size 
                        - a demon's wings are in fact so powerful that they can hover in the air for significant periods of time. Demons vary in size from babies 
                        the size of household cats to the largest encountered in the level, "The Crossing"; this demon is the size of a large horse. Demons produce 
                        roars that seem to be a guttural version of a tiger's growl. Because their eyes are quite small and on the sides of their head, it's unlikely 
                        that the demons hunt by sight. Their large nasal ducts suggest a powerful sense of smell.

                    <p>
                        Nosalises are the standard enemy of the Metro game series. They are fierce predators, extremely territorial, and can easily overwhelm 
                        fortified positions in large numbers. Nosalises differ from most other mutant types by the sheer number of variant subspecies that exist 
                        under the generalisation of "nosalis". Common between all types, however, is a bipedal and humanoid shape with two arms and legs, arched 
                        spines, and large round heads that prominently display big noses, gaping jaws, and huge teeth. Their nests are seemingly everywhere in the 
                        metro, but the creatures are less frequently seen on the surface. Nosalises seem to be derived from moles, as indicated by their Latin name, 
                        as well as their prominent snout and large claws. Like most animal inhabitants of the Metro and surface, they have undergone extreme mutation 
                        due to prolonged radioactive exposure. Some nosalis variants may instead be derived from shrews or desmans, both of which were native to Russia 
                        before the war.

                        In both canons, librarians are much less deformed than other mutants of the Metro, resembling ordinary gorillas in both posture and 
                        overall physical appearance, though they are much larger and have longer and thinner arms. In the game however, they have a fearsome 
                        visage, as their faces, somewhat humanoid, have one lip that covers their shark-like teeth and snout. This is caused by the nose and 
                        upper lip of their human progenitors fusing over successive generations. They are very territorial and will confront anything that 
                        appears to be a threat. They show signs of aggression by roaring and raising their upper lip, showing their teeth as a deterrent like 
                        most modern primates do. They are so powerful and territorial that they will even fight a demon if it enters the Library.

                        The Blind Ones closely resemble pre-war gorillas, except for their complete lack of eyes and their tendency to walk on two legs. 
                        Their lack of eyes means that they primarily rely on sound and smell to locate their prey. Blind Ones are extremely strong and durable, 
                        able to kill any human or similar sized creature in seconds. They are One of the two types of surface mutants found in Novosibirsk, 
                        presumably because they are the only ones able to withstand the radiation levels. The Blind Ones have also developed an ability to 
                        telepathically communicate with each other. They are also able to do so with humans, since Artyom is able to understand them. This suggests 
                        a very high level of intelligence, comparable to the Librarians or even the Dark Ones. Though it is assumed that Artyom's hallucinations in 
                        the Institute are caused by extreme radiation exposure, it's possible that he is being psychically attacked by the Blind Ones. It may be that 
                        both of these factors are happening, since if Artyom stays for too long in a room with a Blind One, some sort of radiation "blowout" will occur. 
                        This "blowout" will disorient both Artyom and any of the Blind Ones caught in it, making them grab their heads and scream in confusion. While they 
                        are extremely territorial in the Institute, they appear to be less hostile while outside, as one can be seen walking away from Artyom when he is traveling 
                        to the Institute.

                    <p>
                        In both the novel and game, the Dark Ones began their existence living in a beehive on the surface at Botanicheskiy Sad 
                        (Botanical Gardens) metro station, which is located north of VDNKh station, Artyom's home. They were first revealed to 
                        mankind not long after a young Artyom opened the great Hermetic Door of Botanicheskiy Sad to glimpse the surface. Eventually, 
                        the Dark Ones found this entrance and explored the Metro, VDNKh being the first station and human contact they came across. They were not 
                        bloodthirsty beasts as most of the inhabitants of the Metro believed, but sentient beings wanting nothing more but peace with humanity. 
                        Metro citizens didn't understand their desire to live in a symbiotic society, thus "striking back" before any attempt to create peace was ever 
                        made. As the Dark Ones would approach VDNKh in long strides, trying to simply walk into the station, the station guard would fire upon them out 
                        of fear, desperation, and a sudden onset of madness. It is revealed in The Gospel According to Artyom, and suggested by the opening scene in Metro: 
                        Last Light, that the Dark Ones never intended for the death of humans, yet their very presence and psychic influence drove the humans mad, and they 
                        subsequently killed each other.
