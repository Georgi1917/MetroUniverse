                            With the largest population in the Metro (estimated at 15,000), an unparalleled capacity for mass conscription, and a number of stations 
                            and metres of track surpassed only by Hansa, the Red Line is one of the most formidable factions in the post-apocalyptic world. Juxtaposed 
                            to Hanza's policy of political ambivalence and economic hegemony, the Red Line pursues a policy of violent expansion whenever possible, as 
                            showcased by its permanent state of conflict with the fascist Fourth Reich, crimes committed against non-aligned stations, and conflict with 
                            the Rangers over the Д-6 military installation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Red Line is a single-party state ruled by the Communist Party of the Moscow Underground and its General Secretary, Maxim Moskvin. Following 
                            a Marxist-Leninist and Neo-Stalinist ideology, political repression and indoctrination is an everyday part of life for Line citizens, considered 
                            a vital tool if the Party is to maintain its ascendancy or prevent fascist infiltration.

                        <p>
                            Upon formation and acquiring a decent foothold in the metro, Hansa quickly developed into the metro's economic powerhouse, a 
                            hyper-capitalist utopia for the rich. It's one of the few places in the metro where public transportation, running water, and 
                            large-scale electric lighting are widespread. They usually make "partnerships" with stations outside of the Ring (such as the Arbat 
                            Confederation and Belorusskaya Trade Outpost), causing those stations to become resource-stations dependent on Hanza. While not dependent on 
                            Hansa for resources, both the Fourth Reich and Red Line maintain trade-relationships with Hanza.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Hansa and Polis seem the most democratic factions within the metro; many citizens from the Fourth Reich and Red Line expressed wanting to 
                            move to Hanza or Polis. However, both the Communists and Nazis have no tolerance for refugees: both groups usually kill arriving refugees. 
                            Those lucky enough to arrive at a Hanseatic station are often turned away due to Hansa's suspicion of outsiders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Hansa is well-militarized to protect its wealth; all its stations are heavily guarded, it boasts motor-transportation and flamethrowers, 
                            and its militia is outfitted with high-end military grade weapons. Hanseatic stations also appear austere when it comes to entering and 
                            leaving stations, with non-Hansa personnel requiring passports or other forms of identification as well as having their weapons confiscated 
                            from them until they leave the station.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The station has also managed to salvage an incredible amount of pre-war technology, including plastic quarantine sheeting, 
                            metal detectors, working on computers, medical scanning equipment, and biohazard gear.

                            Polis is formed by the Arbatskaya, Aleksandrovskiy Sad, Biblioteka Lenina, and Borovitskaya stations. Above ground is the Moscow State 
                            Library, formally known as Lenin Library. Throughout the Metro, Polis is known as a station with wealth and power. The platforms which 
                            encompass Polis seem to have been taken up by various machinery, with near building-like structures taking the place of housing. In the novel, 
                            there is a caste system consisting of the Shudra, who are the servants; the Vashiya, a group of dedicated Polis merchants; Kshatriya, composed 
                            of former Russian Army soldiers, special forces, and government agents who make up the defense force; and finally Brahmins, who are the pre-war 
                            scientists, teachers, and other important keepers of knowledge.

                            In the game Metro 2033, the hierarchy is not set into groups but instead one group. It's known as the Polis Council. Not much is known about the group 
                            apart from the fact that they either genuinely don't care much for VDNKh and the Dark Ones or are simply incapable of sparing resources to counter this threat.

                            Polis is a unique city-state of the Metro. Only there do the keepers of old pre-war knowledge remain in substantial quantity. All scientific knowledge became 
                            useless for other Metro states, as they slowly descended into the abyss of chaos and ignorance. Scientists from everywhere, where their skills were useless, 
                            came to Polis. Only there could one meet elderly professors from pre-war universities, the last artists, artisans, musicians, poets, physicists, chemists, biologists, 
                            and mathematicians. All those who kept the knowledge achieved by thousands of years of human history, that may or will be lost forever once they pass away. The station 
                            is also considered to be the birth place of the Rangers of Order.

                            The Nazis are a national socialist faction in the Metro centred around the three main stations of Tverskaya, Chekhovskaya, and Pushkinskaya 
                            which they dub "The Reich". However, they maintain numerous outposts and a military presence in several outlying stations, possibly in an 
                            attempt at expansion since the Nazis are an imperialist faction. They are headed by one man, the Führer, and obey his every command (giving 
                            the impression of a dictatorship). The Fourth Reich as a whole is split into three sections: the Nazis, its military, and the Reich itself.

                            To completely understand the Nazis, it's important to understand their ideology. They formed their organization based on the Third Reich of 
                            Nazi Germany. However, it isn't for German purity, like their predecessor, but rather for the genetic purity free of deformities. For example, 
                            anybody that has even the slightest deformity found in the Metro is considered a lower race and treated as second class. However, another trait 
                            unique to the post-war world is the strict regulations they heavily emphasize. The Reich is always improving their standards. They want humanity 
                            to be rid of abnormal genes caused by radiation. If a person is missing two fingers or even a toe, the penalty is death. Recently, more strict 
                            standards have been imposed such as height and even head size. The Reich's race and genetic standards cause many people living inside the Reich 
                            to become refugees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Reich is a totalitarian dictatorship alongside the Red Line. As such, it's led by one man - the Führer. What he says goes and any question 
                            to it usually results in execution. He enforces strict anti-mutation and physical feature standards policy on what it is to be a "Pure Human". 
                            It's common policy that if one of these features is not perfect, one is considered a mutant and executed. The Führer's choleric attitude combined 
                            with the amount of power he holds is, just like his moniker, modelled on Adolf Hitler.
